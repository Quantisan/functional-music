* first steps

  1. make sure you have =Emacs 24.3= or above and =git=
  2. rename your current emacs config files (=~/.emacs=, =~/.emacs.d= to
     something else)
  2. git clone https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live

     it is possible to run overtone in your own environment, but
     =emacs-live= saves you a lot of trouble. however, it is also a
     highly opinionated starter kit and comes with a bunch of
     pre-cusomizations.  to add your own and play nice with the
     emacs-live defaults, follow the instructions at

     http://overtone.github.io/emacs-live/doc-customisation.html
